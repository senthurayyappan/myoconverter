# MyoConverter
**MyoConverter** is a tool for converting OpenSim musculoskeletal (MSK) models to the MuJoCo model format with optimized muscle kinematics and kinetics.

Building upon the foundation of the previous [O2MConverter](https://github.com/aikkala/O2MConverter) project, we extensively rewrote the functions, incorporated new features, and ensured compatibility with the latest OpenSim 4.0+ models. Additionally, two optimization steps were introduced to enhance the accuracy of muscle properties in both kinematics and kinetics.

See the [documentation](https://myoconverter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information about the converter and the conversion process.

## Example models
Here we present a few example models that have been processed with the MyoConverter tool. We try to keep these converted models up-to-date (in case of bug fixes etc.), but it is recommended to run the conversions yourself to ensure up-to-date models.

Please also see [this list of models](https://myoconverter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html) converted using MyoConverter.

**_NOTE:_** Speed test was done on a *12th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-12500H × 16*. Parallel computing is implemented, so more Threads in CPU will lead to faster conversion.    

**_NOTE:_** The converted XML model contains a keyframe which should be used when initialising the model. This keyframe sets the joint values such that all the joint/muscle path constraints are met. However, MuJoCo does not load the keyframe by default. When using the MuJoCo `simulate` GUI, please hit the `Load key` button to load the keyframe. When loading the model using MuJoCo P  ython bindings, you can use following functions to load the keyframe:
```python
import mujoco
model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path("path/to/model.xml")
data = mujoco.MjData(model)
mujoco.mj_resetDataKeyframe(model, data, 0)
```

## Download & Setup

We recommend installing MyoConverter via conda / mamba if you're running Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 & 22.04). In earlier development phases we encountered issues in Windows. Hence, for Windows / MacOS users, we provide a docker image (follow [this link](./docker/README.md) for more instructions), which contains the tested Linux setup. If you try the conda / mamba approach on Windows / MacOS, please let us know how it goes!

**Note:** This package is also available on PyPI for Linux and macOS as a self-contained wheel via [pyopensim](https://pypi.org/project/pyopensim/), which includes all necessary OpenSim dependencies.

### conda / mamba

- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MyoHub/myoconverter.git; cd myoconverter
```

- Create a conda environment with the `conda_env.yml` file
```bash
conda env create -n myoconverter -f conda_env.yml
conda activate myoconverter
```

**Note** conda is very slow in solving the dependencies and installing the environment (>15 minutes). We recommend installation via [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) instead, which installs the environment in a couple of minutes. With mamba, the environment is created by replacing `conda` with `mamba`:
```bash
mamba env create -n myoconverter -f conda_env.yml
mamba activate myoconverter
```

- Add MyoConverter project folder to PYTHONPATH
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/myoconverter
```

- Optional: Test installation by running a model unit test
  
```bash
python myoconverter/tests/model_unit_test.py
```


## Quick example

#### Call a Python function

```python
from myoconverter.O2MPipeline import O2MPipeline

# define pipeline configurations
kwargs = {}  # define kwargs inputs
kwargs['convert_steps'] = [1, 2, 3]    # All three steps selected
kwargs['muscle_list'] = None           # No specific muscle selected, optimize all of them
kwargs['osim_data_overwrite'] = True   # Overwrite the Osim model state files
kwargs['conversion'] = True            # Yes, perform 'Cvt#' process
kwargs['validation'] = True            # Yes, perform 'Vlt#' process
kwargs['speedy'] = False               # Do not reduce the checking notes to increase speed
kwargs['generate_pdf'] = True          # Do not generate validation pdf report
kwargs['add_ground_geom'] = True       # Add ground to the model
kwargs['treat_as_normal_path_point'] = False    # Using constraints to represent moving and conditional path points

############### Simple Arm 2 DoFs 6 Muscles ################ 
osim_file = './models/osim/Arm26/arm26.osim'
geometry_folder = './models/osim/Arm26/Geometry'
output_folder = './models/mjc/Arm26'
O2MPipeline(osim_file, geometry_folder, output_folder, **kwargs)
```
